A little bit of fun while writing some tests. See [here][creed] for the inspration.

```csharp
    private const string testStringCreed = @"
    This is my test string. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

    My test string is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

    My test string, without me, is useless. Without my test string, I am useless.
    I must declare my test string with the correct syntax. I must test first, rather than
    my enemy who is testing after. I must refactory only when I have a passing test in place.

    My test string and I know that what counts in code is not the SLOC we write, the number of
    unit tests, nor the tooling generated code coverage percentage. We know that it is correct 
    execution of our code that counts.

    My test string is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother.
    I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its declaration syntax, its character encoding, 
    its termination character (if any), and it mutability. I will keep my test string clean and ready,
    even as I am clean and ready. We will become a part of each other.

    Before God, I swear this creed. My test string and I are the defenders of my code. We are the
    masters of code correctness. We are the saviors of my software quality.

    So be it, until the test run is complete and there is no red, bu only green!";
