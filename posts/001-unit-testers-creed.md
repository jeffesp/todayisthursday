When writing some testing code, I found I needed a test string. For whatever
reason my mind jumped to the [Rifleman's Creed][creed] as popularized in [Full
Metal Jacket][fmj].  So I had a little bit of fun with it.

```
    private const string unitTestersCreed = @"
    This is my test class. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

    My test class is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as
    I must master my life.

    My test class, without me, is useless. Without my test class, I am
    useless.  I must declare my test class with the correct syntax. I
    must test first, rather than my enemy who is testing after. I must
    refactor only when I have a passing test in place.

    My test class and I know that what counts in code is not the SLOC we
    write, the number of tests, nor the tooling generated code coverage
    percentage. We know that it is correct execution of our code that
    counts.

    My test class is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I
    will learn it as a brother.  I will learn its weaknesses, its
    strength, its test declaration syntax, its assertion library, its
    mocking capability, and its test runner options.

    I will keep my test class clean and ready, even as I am clean and
    ready. We will become a part of each other.

    Before God, I swear this creed. My test class and I are the
    defenders of my code. We are the masters of code correctness. We are
    the saviors of my software quality.

    So be it, until the test run is complete and there is no red but
    only green!";
